/**
 * First real use of NeoForge's GameTest harness in this port - replaces "boot a dedicated server and grep
 * its log for a recipe count" as the way to verify actual game logic, not just that nothing crashed at
 * startup. Registered explicitly via {@code Thaumcraft#onRegisterGameTests} rather than relying on
 * {@code @GameTestHolder} auto-discovery, so there's one obvious place that lists what test classes exist.
 *
 * Run with {@code ./gradlew runGameTestServer} (see build.gradle's {@code gameTestServer} run - it refuses
 * to start at all with zero registered tests, which is why this project relied on full {@code runServer}
 * boots until now). Every test uses {@code data/thaumcraft/structure/empty.nbt}, a hand-built 1x1x1
 * all-air structure (GameTest requires *some* structure to exist even when a test never touches a block -
 * there's no built-in placeholder) - these tests are pure logic checks that happen to run inside a game
 * test world, not world-interaction tests.
 *
 * {@code @PrefixGameTestTemplate(false)} at the class level: without it, NeoForge silently prefixes
 * every {@code template()} with the class's simple name (e.g. "empty" becomes "thaumcraftgametests.empty"),
 * which doesn't match the actual structure resource name and fails every test with a "Missing test
 * structure" crash before any test logic runs - found by actually running
 * {@code ./gradlew runGameTestServer} and reading the crash, not by guessing.
